<h1>CS:GO Ported Models</h1>

<p>These are some models that I ported from another games (e.g Garry's Mod) that I had for my servers.</p>
<p>Since I don't have them anymore and people still wants them, I decided to publish them.</p>
<p>Every model's folder has their materials, with a respective <b>TXT File</b> with their paths.</p>
<p>You also can find some previews as you search inside the folders, to see how the models look.</p>
